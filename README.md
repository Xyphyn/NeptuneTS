**DISCONTINUED**

A general purpose bot designed to handle many parts of your server.

## Moderation Features
Neptune, like most bots, has many moderation features. It has an auto-mute system, (soon to be configurable) and provides a simple and intuitive punishment configuration.

## Fun Commands
Like any good bot, Neptune has some boredom-killing functions. These include a reddit command, to view hilarious reddit posts with your friends, cat pictures 😸, weird facts, and more.

## Other
Of course, Neptune is not made to be just like any other bot. There are constantly new features being added, such as automatic translation, image commands, and more to come!

### Notice
This bot is ***not*** intended for self hosting. Change the code yourself if you want to host it yourself.

I decided to make this open source. Please don't abuse exploits you find, and instead report them in the issues tab. 😁
